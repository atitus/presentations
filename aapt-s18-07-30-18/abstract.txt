Integrating Computation into Courses from General Education to Intermediate Physics

I first integrated computation into my calculus-based physics course in 2003 through the "Matter & Interactions" textbook by Chabay and Sherwood. This eventually led to a physics degree program launched in 2010 in which every course for physics majors includes computation. Now, two of our general education physics courses include computation. We have learned the following lessons: (1) provide explicit instruction in computation during lab or class (i.e. computing should not be relegated to homework); (2) in introductory classes, reduce technical barriers associated with software installation; (3) transform what you teach to include iterative thinking. I will present these lessons and show examples of computing across the curriculum.
