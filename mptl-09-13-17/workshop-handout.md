### Abstract

Jupyter Notebook (formerly iPython Notebook) is a web application to create and share documents that contain live code, visualizations, and marked-up text and equations. Accessible to students and scalable to professionals, Jupyter Notebook is ideal for writing *code- and data- driven narratives* and is useful both for research and for teaching computational modeling, data visualization, collaborative computing, and reporting. Furthermore, the latest version of VPython runs in Jupyter Notebook.

## Agenda

- **14:25 - 14:40**:  Presentation (What is Jupyter?)
- **14:40 - 14:55**:  Explore Example Notebooks
- **14:55 - 15:10**:  Explore Workshop Notebooks
